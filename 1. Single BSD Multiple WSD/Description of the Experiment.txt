Experiment Title: Multi-Device Data Transmission using a Single LoRa Receiver

 
Experiment Description:

In this experiment, we aim to investigate the process of transmitting data from multiple WSDs (Tx devices) to a single BSD (Rx devices), using LoRa and observe how the data is transmitted and sorted.

NOTE:  Users are encouraged to utilize the provided code and reference the experimental setup image to gain practical insights into LoRa multi-device communication.

Experimental Setup:

1. GoldAid Devices (1 No. (BSD) + 2 or more (WSD))


**Observations and Analysis:**

During the experiment, the following observations and analyses are made:

1. **Data Reception**: The receiver captures data packets from the multiple Tx devices. The experiment aims to determine if any data loss or packet collision occurs and how the receiver handles such situations.

2. **Data Sorting**: The received data packets are sorted based on the unique identifiers or addressing information from each Tx device. This step helps in distinguishing data from different sources.

3. **Packet Integrity**: The experiment assesses the integrity of the received data packets, checking for any corruption or loss due to interference.

4. **Delay and Latency**: The experiment measures the delay or latency in receiving data from each Tx device to evaluate the timing aspects of multi-device communication.

**Conclusion:**

This experiment provides valuable insights into the capabilities of LoRa technology for handling data transmission from multiple Tx devices. It helps in understanding how data is sorted and processed by a single LoRa receiver, including the challenges and limitations associated with multi-device communication. The findings from this experiment contribute to the optimization and design of LoRa-based IoT and remote monitoring systems where multiple devices need to transmit data efficiently and reliably to a central receiver.
