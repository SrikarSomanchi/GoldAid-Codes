Experiment Title: Multi-Device Data Transmission using a Single LoRa Receiver

 
Experiment Description:

In this experiment, we aim to investigate the process of transmitting data from multiple WSDs (Tx devices) to a single BSD (Rx devices), using LoRa and observe how the data is transmitted and sorted.

NOTE:  Users are encouraged to utilize the provided code and reference the experimental setup image to gain practical insights into LoRa multi-device communication.

Experimental Setup:

1. GoldAid Devices (1 No. (BSD) + 2 or more (WSD))
2. PC with installed Arduino IDE

Procedure: 
1. Upload the BSD code in the BSD device and the WSD code in the WSD device by changing the "Device IDs" within the code.
2. Place the antennas of the devices in appropriate positions and place the devices at a certain distance.
3. Observe and record the data transmission and data loss (if any).


Observations and Analysis

During the experiment, the following observations and analyses are possibly made:
1. By changing the Spreadind Factor of the devices, the range varies accordingly.
2. Loss in datapackets or no communication from few of the WSD nodes due to Data Collision.

Conclusion:

This experiment provides valuable insights into the capabilities of LoRa technology for handling data transmission from multiple Tx devices. It helps in understanding how data is sorted and processed by a single LoRa receiver, including the challenges and limitations associated with multi-device communication. The findings from this experiment contribute to the optimization and design of LoRa-based IoT and remote monitoring systems where multiple devices need to transmit data efficiently and reliably to a central receiver.
